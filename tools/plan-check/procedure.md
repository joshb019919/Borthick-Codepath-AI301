# Procedure: how this skill grades a plan package

<!--
THIS IS THE PART YOU WRITE, and it is a new kind of part. Weeks 1 and
2, SKILL.md carried a numbered workflow and you only wrote judgment
files. This week the workflow is gone from the frame: SKILL.md says
"execute procedure.md", and these are the operating steps you author.
The machinery is in your hands now.

Your operator swap is the design brief. When your executor stalled
because your rubric said WHAT to decide but not HOW to find the
evidence, that was a procedure gap. This file is where those gaps get
closed: a complete procedure lets someone who has never seen a plan
package before (a groupmate, or the skill itself) grade one exactly the
way you would.

Under each stage heading below, write the concrete steps for that
stage. The one-line note under each heading says what a complete
procedure must decide there. Write steps, not intentions: "read the
repro evidence before the plan, and note what behavior it pins down"
is a step; "understand the context" is a wish.
-->

## Read order

<!-- What gets read, in what order, before any check is graded, and
what to note down from each part while reading. A complete procedure
decides the order (issue first? repro evidence first?) and says why
the order matters for the checks that come later. -->

In live mode, read `scope.md` and confirm the issue is inside the
scoped source; note any house rules. Then (both modes) read
`rubric.md` and `references/evidence-guide.md`. List the rubric's
checks and its verdict rule.

Read the whole package before grading anything: the issue context
first, then the claim comment, then the repro report. The deciding
evidence is usually whether the report's artifacts show the
behavior the issue describes.

All text associated with the student's comment on the issue will be 
in plan.md and plan of action will be in comment.md.

## Evidence gathering

<!-- For each evidence family your rubric's checks name, the concrete
gathering move: which part of the package (or, live, which page or
thread location per your evidence guide) to pull the fact from, and
what to record. A complete procedure leaves no check whose evidence an
executor would have to hunt for. -->

For each check, gather exactly the evidence the rubric names, using
the evidence guide's map.
- Live mode: gather issue-side evidence from the locations the
    guide names; the drafts are the candidate side.
- Eval mode: quote the relevant lines from the bundle.

## Check execution

<!-- How one check runs against gathered evidence: in what order the
checks execute, what an executor does when evidence for a check is
genuinely absent, and when a check may be graded without re-reading
the whole package. A complete procedure makes two executors grade the
same package the same way. -->

Grade each check `pass`, `fail`, or `unclear`, with a one-line
evidence quote or fact for each grade. `unclear` means the evidence
needed is genuinely absent, not that you did not look.

## Verdict assembly

<!-- How the per-check grades become the final accept or reject:
apply your rubric's verdict rule, state how unclear grades enter it,
and say what gets quoted in the output for the deciding check. A
complete procedure produces the same verdict from the same grades,
every time. -->

A per-check grade becomes a final accept if the pass condition is met,
else it is a rejection.  Unclear means you're not sure or the pass
condition is not well defined.  If unclear, state this to the user. 
If rejection, state this to the user and why.
